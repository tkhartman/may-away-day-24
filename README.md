# may-away-day-24

# Description
This repository was prepared for The Department of Social Statistics Research Away Day at The University of Manchester, or what I've affectionately labelled the "May (Away) Day '24". Let's hope the session is more reminiscent of the spring festivals than the call of distress! 

Contained within are a few slides about psychometric network analysis, as well an application in R.
